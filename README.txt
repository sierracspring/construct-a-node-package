Throughout this assignment we've used NPM Package and 
Node Module as if they were the same, while there are 
similarities, how do they differ from one another?
-The NPM package contains all the files needed for the 
 Node Module, which is the JavaScript library.

If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that
code with the community?
-This could be done by using React and hosting the project
 with a program like Netlify.
